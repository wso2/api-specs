            provides our users with the knowledge they need to make strategic decisions
            and develop practical solutions to achieve their missions. \n\nOur GuideStar
            searchable database currently includes data on 1.9 million 501c3 entities,
            making it easier to understand who they are and what they do. We support
            ongoing learning and research by gathering, indexing, and sharing the
            sector’s collective knowledge on IssueLab while also producing our own
            research that shares insights on issues affecting the social sector. We
            provide data and knowledge to the philanthropic field by creating new
            issue-based web portals known as “Foundation Landscapes” on the topics
            that matter most to the sector. Through Glasspockets we provide the data,
            resources, examples, and action steps foundations need to understand the
            value of transparency, be more open in their own communications, and help
            shed more light on how private organizations are serving the public good.
            Candid works closely with organizations around the globe to assist them
            in collecting and organizing their region’s philanthropy data by sharing
            what we have learned over the past 60 years about data acquisition and
            data architecture. \n\nCandid’s CF Insights program is the leader in data
            collection and research for the community foundation field in the U.S.
            with a reputation for benchmarking and analysis of trends. Through CF
            Insights, we continue to deliver a high level of service to our members
            and worked with partners to release groundbreaking research on the need
            for increased collaboration amongst leaders of community foundations.\n\nWe
            also have a number of blogs across our platforms (including the GuideStar
            blog, GrantSpace blog, GrantCraft blog, GlassPockets blog, Philanthropy
            News Digest Blog, and more!) that shine a light on relevant topics and
            trends affecting the sector."

            searchable database currently includes data on 1.9 million 501c3 entities,
            making it easier to understand who they are and what they do. We support
            ongoing learning and research by gathering, indexing, and sharing the
            sector’s collective knowledge on IssueLab while also producing our own
            research that shares insights on issues affecting the social sector. We
            provide data and knowledge to the philanthropic field by creating new
            issue-based web portals known as “Foundation Landscapes” on the topics
            that matter most to the sector. Through Glasspockets we provide the data,
            resources, examples, and action steps foundations need to understand the
            value of transparency, be more open in their own communications, and help
            shed more light on how private organizations are serving the public good.
            Candid works closely with organizations around the globe to assist them
            in collecting and organizing their region’s philanthropy data by sharing
            what we have learned over the past 60 years about data acquisition and
            data architecture. \n\nCandid’s CF Insights program is the leader in data
            collection and research for the community foundation field in the U.S.
            with a reputation for benchmarking and analysis of trends. Through CF
            Insights, we continue to deliver a high level of service to our members
            and worked with partners to release groundbreaking research on the need
            for increased collaboration amongst leaders of community foundations.\n\nWe
            also have a number of blogs across our platforms (including the GuideStar
            blog, GrantSpace blog, GrantCraft blog, GlassPockets blog, Philanthropy
            News Digest Blog, and more!) that shine a light on relevant topics and

            "As of February 2019, GuideStar joined forces with Foundation Center
            to become a new organization called Candid. The below reflects GuideStar’s
            historical programs as of January 31, 2019.\n\nAcross the globe, nonprofits
            play an important role within the evolving social contract: they provide
            services, drive innovation, and shape political discourse. Unfortunately,
            the culture and systems of the nonprofit sector do not always drive excellence,
            learning, or collaboration. The whole is less than the sum of its parts.
            For example: \n\n- proven impact rarely draws additional capital; \n-
            failure seldom drives learning; \n- shared goals rarely inspire collaboration;
            \ \n- the voices of those we try to serve are lost.  \n\nThese obstacles
            limit the overall impact of the field. Until we fix these problems the
            nonprofit sector will continue to underperform—with profound consequences
            across society."
