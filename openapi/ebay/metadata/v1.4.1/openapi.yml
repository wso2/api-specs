      description: 'This method returns item condition metadata on one, multiple, or all eBay categories on an eBay marketplace. This metadata consists of the different item conditions (with IDs) that an eBay category supports, and a boolean to indicate if an eBay category requires an item condition. The identifier of the eBay marketplace is passed in as a path parameter, and unless one or more eBay category IDs are passed in through the filter query parameter, this method will return metadata on every single category for the specified marketplace. If you only want to view item condition metadata for one eBay category or a select group of eBay categories, you can pass in up to 50 eBay category ID through the filter query parameter. Important!: Certified Refurbished-eligible sellers must use an OAuth token created with the authorization code grant flow and https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.inventory scope in order to retrieve the ''Certified Refurbished'' condition (condition ID 2000) for the relevant categories. The Certified Refurbished item condition will not be returned if an OAuth token created with the client credentials grant flow and https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope scope is used, or if any seller is not eligible to list with that item condition. See the Specifying OAuth scopes topic for more information about specifying scopes. Tip: If you retrieve metadata on all eBay categories for a marketplace, the response payload can be quite large. For this reason, we suggest that you consider using the Accept-Encoding request header and set its value to application/gzip. By doing this, the response payload output will be compressed into a GZIP file.'

You can limit the size of the result set by using the filter query parameter to specify only the category IDs you want to review.

A category tree is a hierarchical framework of eBay categories that begins at the root node of the tree and extends to include all the child nodes in the tree. Each child node in the tree is an eBay category that is represented by a unique categoryId value. Within a category tree, the root node has no parent node and leaf nodes are nodes that have no child nodes.'
