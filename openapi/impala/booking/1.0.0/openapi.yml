        Returns the full content, room types and rates for the specified hotel.


        When querying the hotels API you can query with or without dates. Where
        querying with dates requires providing valid values for the `start` and
        `end` parameters. Requests without these values will be considered a
        query without dates.


        **Querying without dates:**


        When you query without dates, the search result will include all
        properties that match your request. Including all content that is
        associated with those properties. However you will find that the `rates`
        attribute for each room will always be empty.


        **Querying with dates:**


        When you query with dates, the search result will include all properties
        that match your request, including all content that is associated with
        those properties. However, hotels with no available rooms will be
        filtered out of the result. For the remaining hotels all rooms will be
        represented within the result regardless of whether they are available.
        Rooms which do not have available prices for the provided dates will
        appear with an empty `rates` array.


        For rooms where there are available prices the `rates` array will
        include both the public rates of the hotel, along with prices that come
        from deals in which you are participating. This would include private
        deals which you have negotiated with a hotel, along with Impala deals
        which you have been verified for.


        Using the `rateId` of any of those rates, you can use the [Create a
        booking](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1bookings/post)
        endpoint to make a booking.

      summary: List all rate plans (rate calendar) for a hotel (Beta endpoint)
      operationId: listRatePlans
      description: >-
        Returns a list of all rate plans available for you for a hotel.


        Rate plans are products the hotel is offering. They typically consist of
        a combination of restrictiveness in case of cancellations or changes,
        the time they're bookable, minimum or maximum length of stay
        restrictions (e.g. week-long bookings), included components like
        breakfast or dinner and/or the conditions under which the room can be
        sold (e.g. private rates that can only be offered and sold to a closed
        user group behind login).


        Examples of rate plans:


        * Non-refundable room rate that includes breakfast

        * Room-only rate with free cancellation up to 14 days before arrival


        For each such rate plan this endpoint returns the room types it's
        available for, alongside prices for each date and occupancy that can be
        sold – or the information that the room isn't available (closed) for a
        certain date.


        For the vast majority of our customers, availability searches using the
        [List all
        hotels](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1hotels/get)
        endpoint are the best choice. It accepts the dates your guest is looking
        for and provides the rates to display.


        This endpoint can help augment this for two additional use cases:


        This endpoint allows you to query rate prices for all future dates in
        one go, making it a great choice to feed availability information and
        prices into your own system or displaying a rate calender to guide your
        guests to gain an overview of future availability and prices.

      summary: List all hotels
      operationId: listHotels
      description: >-
        Returns a list of all hotels worldwide that can be booked through
        Impala.

        You can **filter** the results:

        * Adding `longitude`, `latitude` and a `radius` (in meters) query
        parameters will filter the results to hotels around this location.

        * Adding `start` and `end` dates (in ISO 8601 notation, e.g.
        `2021-12-31`) for the expected arrival and departure dates of your
        guests will limit the results to hotels that have at least one room
        bookable for this timeframe.

        * Adding `starRating`, `name` or `country` allows you to filter to
        hotels based on these values (e.g.
        `?starRating[gte]=4&name[like]=palace` for hotels with a rating of 4 or
        up with a name containing "palace")

        * Adding `hotelIds` allows you to limit the results to include only
        hotels with the ids listed. Its value should be a comma-separated list
        of hotel ids (e.g. `?hotelIds={hotelId},{hotelId}`).


        You can specify the **sorting order** in which hotels are returned:

        * This is done by using the `sortBy` query parameter.

        * Results can be sorted by `name` alphabetically, star `rating` and
        `distance_m` (in meters from the specified latitude/longitude location).

        * The parameter allows for a comma-separated list of arguments with
        optional `:asc` (ascending, the default if the modifier is omitted) and
        `:desc` (descending) modifiers.


        If no hotels match your filter criteria, an empty array will be
        returned.

        > Updates the specified booking with immediate effect. This action might
        result in a cancellation charge being charged.


        > Please note that if you wish to change the contact details associated
        with a booking, you should use the [Change a Booking's Contact
        Details](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1bookings~1%7BbookingId%7D~1booking-contact/put)
        endpoint.


        Changes / updates a confirmed booking with the details you provide in
        the request body.


        When your guest needs to change their booking, you can use this endpoint
        to change any of the details you initially supplied when you [made their
        booking](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1bookings/post),
        e.g. you'll need to query for availability and use the
        `roomTypes[].rates[].rateId` that are available currently for their new
        stay dates. Any new rates selected must be for the same hotel as the
        original booking.


        A booking cannot be updated on or after the check in day of the original
        or new stay.


        In addition, we require you do supply a
        `updateBookingVersionAtTimestamp` field with the `updatedAt` timestamp
        of the booking. You can find this value by looking up the booking via
        the [Retrieve a
        booking](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1bookings~1%7BbookingId%7D/get)
        endpoint. This is to avoid race conditions where another update might
        have happened since the last time you have checked for the current
        details of this booking.


        The `status` of this booking will switch back to `PENDING` until we have
        submitted and confirmed the new details with the hotel.


        <!-- theme: warning -->


        > **This request might take up to 20 seconds to load.** While we work to
        return a response to your request within milliseconds in most cases,
        some bookings require us to re-verify current pricing in real-time and
        doing so might take up to 20 seconds. Please make sure your app handles
        this waiting state appropriately.

        > Cancels the specified booking with immediate effect. This action might
        result in a cancellation charge being charged.


        Submitting this request means we'll notify the hotel of the cancellation
        and that they won't expect your guest.


        You can use `GET /bookings/{bookingId}`to see the cancellation policies
        that apply to a booking at a given point in time. Please note that
        cancelling a booking will incur a cancellation fee according to the
        rules that apply at the time of cancellation. You can find the
        cancellation fee that has been charged in the response of this call in
        the `cancellation.fee` object.


        If the booking you cancelled allows for a partial or full refund, we'll
        credit your Impala balance with the amount we charged you as the seller
        of this booking – meaning we'll deduct the amount the next time we're
        requesting payment for the sum of all the bookings you made.

        > Please refer to the [supported booking
        workflows](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/docs/good-to-know/booking-workflows.md) 
        to get a better understanding of the purpose of this endpoint.


        > To change **only** the contact details of a guest for a booking,
        please use the `/bookings/{bookingId}/booking-contact` endpoint.


        When your guest needs to change their booking, you can use this endpoint
        to change the details you initially supplied when you made their
        booking.


        A booking cannot be updated on or after the check in day of the original
        or new stay.


        In addition, we require you do supply a
        `updateBookingVersionAtTimestamp` field with the `updatedAt` timestamp
        of the booking. You can find this value by looking up the booking via
        the [Retrieve a
        booking](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1bookings~1%7BbookingId%7D/get)
        endpoint. This is to avoid race conditions where another update might
        have happened since the last time you have checked for the current
        details of this booking.


        The `status` of this booking will switch back to `PENDING` until we have
        submitted and confirmed the new details with the hotel.

        Updates a confirmed booking with the booking contact details you provide
        in the request body.


        In addition, we require you to supply a
        `updateBookingVersionAtTimestamp` field with the `updatedAt` timestamp
        of the booking. You can find this value by looking up the booking via
        the [Retrieve a
        booking](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1bookings~1%7BbookingId%7D/get)
        endpoint. This is to avoid race conditions where another update might
        have happened since the last time you have checked for the current
        details of this booking.

      summary: Create a booking
      operationId: createBooking
      description: >-
        Creates a booking for for the rate and dates you specify in the request
        body.


        You'll need a `roomTypes[].rates[].rateId` that's bookable for those
        dates, which you can find using the [Retrieve a
        hotel](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1hotels~1%7BhotelId%7D/get)
        endpoint.


        There are two different flows depending on how your profile has been
        configured:


        **1. Paid via you**


        If you have provided a credit card on the dashboard then **Impala will
        send the booking to the hotel immediately**. We'll ensure payment is
        taken care of before your guest arrives at the hotel.


        * Your guest needs to be **paying you** the rate specified in
        `retailRate` (as listed in the [Retrieve a
        hotel](https://docs.impala.travel/docs/booking-api/spec/openapi.seller.yaml/paths/~1hotels~1%7BhotelId%7D/get)
        response) before you submit this request.

        * Once your request is received and the booking is confirmed, **Impala
        will charge you** as the seller this `retailRate` minus the
        `sellerCommissionPercentage` (which is the affiliate commission you get
        to keep). We'll use the business credit card you've added to your
        account as payment method for this.

        * The difference between the amount you charge your guest (`retailRate`,
        e.g. 200 €) and what Impala charges you (`retailRate` minus
        `sellerCommissionPercentage`, e.g. 200 €) is your commission (in this
        example: 20 €) to keep.


        You can find more information on how money flows between your guest and
        you, and you and Impala, [in this
        article](https://impala.stoplight.io/docs/booking-api/branches/v1.003/docs/good-to-know/payments-and-commissions.md)


        **2. Payment via the guest**


        If you are set-up to collect payment details, then you can forward these
        to Impala through the`/payments` endpoint. If you are set up for this
        flow then:


        * We will create the booking in a `PENDING` state

        * We will return a `paymentBearerToken` that you must use to authorise
        with the /payments endpoint. This will be valid for **5 minutes** after
        which point the booking will be marked as abandoned.

        * We require you to send a payment auth callback url as part of the
        booking request. This is used in the event that further authorisation is
        required by the paying guests bank. You will need to redirect the guest
        to a URL passed back by the bank. Upon completion they will redirect the
        user back to the URL you sent in the booking request.


        In order to use this endpoint, you must confirm your payment flow and
        API keys with Impala. Please contact support@impala.travel to configure
        your flow.


        <!-- theme: warning -->


        > **This request might take up to 20 seconds to load.** While we work to
        return a response to your request within milliseconds in most cases,
        some bookings require us to re-verify current pricing in real-time and
        doing so might take up to 20 seconds. Please make sure your app handles
        this waiting state appropriately.

        Returns a list of all the bookings you've made.


        You can filter the list based on when bookings were created or last
        updated, as well as their arrival (`start`) and departure (`end`). These
        date-based filters allow to narrow down the result with modifiers for
        less than (`lt`), greater than (`gt`), lower than or equal to (`lte`),
        greater than or equal to (`gte`) and equal to (`eq`).


        Example: Adding the query parameters
        `start[gt]=2021-05-20&updated[lte]=2020-11-20T11:11:00.000Z` would
        return bookings arriving after May 20th, 2020 that were updated before
        or on November 20th, 2020 at 11:11 am UTC.

        Agreements show you which hotels have accepted/rejected the conditions
        of a deal request.


        Deal requests allow you to negotiate conditions that apply to your site
        or app on the Impala platform.


        You should use the agreement endpoints to list the hotels that have
        accepted your deal.
