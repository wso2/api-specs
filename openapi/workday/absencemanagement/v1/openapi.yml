            The valid statuses are Approved, Submitted, Not Submitted, and Sent
            Back. This method does not return Canceled and Denied Time Off
            Entries. To get the Workday ID of a status, call the GET
            /values/timeOff/status endpoint. You can specify multiple status
            query parameters.


            Example:

            An approved Time Off Entry for Vacation 8 hours was corrected to
            Vacation 4 hours and is not in submitted status. If the query
            parameter is status = approved, the Time Off Entry of Vacation, 8
            hours, Approved is returned. If query parameter status = submitted,
            the Time Off Entry of Vacation, 4 hours, Submitted is returned. If
            no query parameter is passed, the Time Off Entry of Vacation, 4
            hours, Submitted is returned.
