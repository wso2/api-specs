    This is a generated connector for [BulkSMS API v1](https://www.bulksms.com/developer/) OpenAPI Specification.

    BulkSMS API provides capability to access you to submit and receive [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com/) messages. You can also get 
    access to past messages and see your account profile. Dates are formatted according to ISO-8601, such as `1970-01-01T10:00:00+01:00` for 1st January 1970, 10AM UTC+1.
    It currently supports operations on messages, numbers, user profile, webhooks, and batch messages.
  version: 1.0.0

      summary: Creates a webhook
      operationId: createWebhook
      description: "A webhook is an URL that you can register when you want the BulkSMS\
        \ system to notify you about your messages.\nYou can register multiple webhooks,\
        \ and each one will be called.  (Note: you can also use our [Web App](https://www.bulksms.com/account/#!/advanced-settings/webhooks)\
        \ to manage your webhooks interactively.)  \nIf you want to be notified of\
        \ `SENT` messages and `RECEIVED` messages you need to create two webhooks.\n\
        \n### Implementing your webhook\n\nCode samples of Webhook implementations:\n\
        * [PHP](samples/webhook-php.html)\n\nWhen you implement your webhook, there\
        \ are a few rules to be aware of:\n- Your webhook must process `POST` requests\
        \ that contains an array of messages in the post body.  This input given to\
        \ your webhook has the same structure as the output produced when you call\
        \ [Retrieve Messages](#tag/Message%2Fpaths%2F~1messages%2Fget).\n- When you\
        \ register or update your webhook, the URL will be tested by invoking it with\
        \ an empty array (`[]`).\n- It is possible for your webhook to receive multiple\
        \ updates for the same message and status. It happens from time to time that\
        \ the mobile network duplicates status updates.\n- The order by which the\
        \ webhook is invoked can be unexpected.  For example, if sender A replies\
        \ before sender B, your webhook might get the reply from B first.\n- The webhook\
        \ is expected to comply with good practices with regard to the status code\
        \ it responds with.\n  - A status code in the `1xx` and `2xx` range is taken\
        \ as an acknowledgement that the invocation was received and that the webhook\
        \ host is ready to receive another.\n  - A status code in the `4xx` range\
        \ is taken as a permanent problem and indicates that the webhook cannot process\
        \ the message. The specific message that caused the error will be discarded,\
        \ but your webhook will be invoked again when another message becomes available.\n\
        \  - Any other status code will be taken as a temporary problem; and indicates\
        \ that the BulkSMS system should retry. The specific message that caused the\
        \ error will not be discarded and your webhook will be invoked again with\
        \ this message (see the subsequent section for more details on retry processing).\n\
        - Your webhook has to respond within `30` seconds.  If no response is given\
        \ in this time, the invocation will be retried.\n- It is good idea to add\
        \ a secret to your URL in order to make it more secure. Here is an example:\n\
        `https://www.example.com/hook.php?secret=pass763265word`\n- You can use a\
        \ non-standard port if necessary, for example: `https://www.example.com:8321/hook.php?secret=pass763265word`\n\
        \n\n### The retry process\n\nThe process the BulkSMS systems follow to handle\
        \ retries is roughly the following:\n- The first retry is scheduled for 90\
        \ seconds into the future.\n- After the first retry, subsequent failures will\
        \ have longer delays, following this sequence - 3 minutes, 6 minutes, 12 minutes\
        \ thereafter the message will be retried every 15 minutes for a 2 day period.\n\
        - When all retries fail, the message will be discarded.\n\n### Problem reports\
        \ via email\n\nYour are strongly advised to provide an email address when\
        \ you register your webhook.\nAn notice will be sent to this email address\
        \ to keep you in the loop whenever there are problems with your webhook.\n\
        In order to prevent your inbox from being flooded, the system sends a notice\
        \ about an observed error no more than once in a 24 hour period.\n\nThe following\
        \ emails can be expected\n - A __message retrying__ email is sent after an\
        \ invocation has failed with a retry-able error.  This email is an early warning,\
        \ allowing you to investigate your systems.\n - A __message discarded__ email\
        \ is sent after failure email is send when a message is discarded as a consequence\
        \ of a non-retry-able error.\n"

      description: |
        Retrieve the messages you have sent or received.

        All the parameters are optional.  If a value is not supplied for `filter`, the messages are not filtered.

        Messages can be filtered by supplying query clauses in the `filter` parameter. Each clause has the form `name=value` where `name` is the name of a filter field and `value` is a valid value for that field.  A value for a field is optional. Include a clause for a field in the filter only when there is a need to fetch messages that match some value for that field.
        For a numeric filter field, you can also use the less than operator (`<`).

        If present, the filter value must have at least one clause, but it can contain a combination of clauses. Multiple clauses are separated with the `&` symbol.  Semantically, multiple clauses form a [logical conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction).

        For example, if you want to list all messages that were sent as part of a particular submission, your filter contains two clauses and will look something like this
        ```
        type%3DSENT&submission.id%3D1-00000000000522347562
        ```
        Because `filter` is a request parameter, it is important to note that the value for this parameter must be *URL encoded*. In particular, the `=` encodes to `%3D` and the `&` encodes to `%26`.  Note that you do not have to encode the `<` character.

        Using the previous example to illustrate; after encoding and encasing it, the clauses are transformed into a request that looks like this
        ```
        GET /v1/messages?filter=type%3DSENT%26submission.id%3D1-00000000000522347562
        ```
        If the field name or the field value of a clause is not valid, a [bad_request error](errors#bad-request) is returned instead of the usual result.  The `detail` field of this error provides more information about the problem.

        The table below lists the fields available for filtering

        | Field | Type   | Values | Note and example |
        |-------|------|--------------------|------|
        | id            | Integer  | Positive integer  | Use the `id` field with `<` (or with `>`) to fetch messages that are older (or newer) than those that are already fetched. <br/>`filter=id<123456` |
        | type          | String  | SENT, RECEIVED  | SENT are Mobile Terminating (MT) SMSs; RECEIVED are Mobile Originating (MO) SMSs.<br/>`filter=type%3DSENT` |
        | submission.id | String  |  | `filter=submission.id%3D1-00000000000522347562` |
        | status.type   | String  | ACCEPTED, SCHEDULED, SENT, DELIVERED, FAILED  | See the message `status.type` field for more information. <br/>`filter=status.type%3DDELIVERED` |
        | status.id| String  |  | See the message `status.id` field for more information. `filter=status.id%3DFAILED.EXPIRED`|
        | submission.date | String | Formatted Date | A fully specified date (e.g. 2017-01-01T10:00:00+01:00).  Use this field with `<=`, `<`, `>` or `>=` to limit the values. <br/>`filter=submission.date%3E%3D2017-01-01T10%3A00%3A00%2B01%3A00` |
        | userSuppliedId  | String | | Use a string value you specified in the `userSuppliedId` property when you sent the message. Only `SENT` messages will be retrieved. <br/>`filter=userSuppliedId%3Dacc009876` |

          The value of `limit` is not a guarantee that a specific number of messages will be in the response, even if there are more messages available.  Consider the case where you have 150 messages and you specify `limit=50`.  It is possible that only 49 messages will be returned.  The  way to make sure that there are no more messages is to submit a new call using the `id` filter field with the `<` operator (described below).

        \ on your account is _yes_ then the message will be repliable. \nIf this setting\
        \ is _no_, the message will not be repliable.\n\n\n#### Body templates\n\n\
        When sending a message you can use template fields to customise the message\
        \ text.\n\n*Field based templates* allow you to create a message with place-holders\
        \ for custom fields.  Fields are identified by a zero based index; the first\
        \ field is `F0`, the second is `F1` and so on.  \n\nFor example, let's say\
        \ you want to send a daily SMS message to all your clients that tell them\
        \ what their current balance is.  The `body` of the message could look something\
        \ like this \n\n```\nGood morning {F0######}, your balance is {F1######}\n\
        ```\n\nIn this message, the first field, `F0`, is the name  of the customer\
        \ and he second field `F1` is the balance for that customer.  The `#` used\
        \ to specify the maximum length  of the field.  Note that the maximum length\
        \ allowed for the value includes the space taken by the braces, template name\
        \ and hash symbol.  For example, the value `{F0#}` specifies a maximum length\
        \ of `5`.  If the data is longer than this length, the data will be truncated\
        \ when the message body is constructed.\n\nThe data fields are provided in\
        \ the property named `fields` in the `to` element.  Here is a complete example\
        \ of how this might look\n\n```\n{\n  \"body\": \"Good morning {F0######},\
        \ your balance is {F1######}\",\n  \"to\":  [\n      {\"address\": \"27456789\"\
        ,\"fields\": [\"Harry\", \"$1345.23\"] },\n      {\"address\": \"27456785\"\
        ,\"fields\": [\"Sally\", \"$2345.58\"] }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you are sending\
        \ to contacts (or to groups) in your phonebook, you can use the *Phonebook\
        \ based templates*.  These are similar to the templates described above, but\
        \ they have specific names. The template for the contact's first name is identified\
        \ by `fn` and the template for the contact's surname is identified by `sn`.\
        \  Below in an example that will work if the numbers are registered in your\
        \ phonebook. \n\n```\n{\n  \"body\": \"Hi {fn######} {sn######}, have a great\
        \ day!\",\n  \"to\":  [\n      {\"address\": \"27456789\" },\n      {\"address\"\
        : \"27456785\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n"

          Safeguards against the possibility of sending the same messages more than once.

          If a communication failure occurs during a submission, you cannot be sure that the submission was processed; therefore you would have to submit it again. When you post the retry, you must use the `deduplication-id` of the original post. The BulkSMS system uses this ID to check that the request was not previously processed. (If it was previously processed, the submission will succeed, and the behaviour will be indistinguishable to you from a non-duplicated submission). The ID expires after about 12 hours.

          \ is `true` then a message containing non-GSM 03.38 characters will be transmitted\
          \ as a Unicode SMS (which is most likely more costly). \n\nPlease note:\

        Blocked numbers are phone numbers to which your account is not permitted to send messages.
        The numbers can be created via this API, by a recipient replying with a STOP message to one
        of your previous SENT messages, or by a BulkSMS administrator.

        Sending a message to a blocked number will result in the message being assigned a status of
        `FAILED.BLOCKED`. Messages sent to blocked numbers are billed to your account.

                The validation for this field depends on the value of the `type`.
                INTERNATIONAL can start with `+`. It has a maximum length of 15 digits, and has to be longer than 6 digits.
                ALPHANUMERIC has a maximum length of 11 characters.
                SHORTCODE has a maximum length of 6 digits.
                REPLIABLE should not specify a value here.

            With SMS messages, it is not possible to link a reply directly with a specific sent message.  However, if you specified `REPLIABLE` in the `from` property, BulkSMS will link any reply to the most recent message sent to a given phone number.
            The `relatedSentMessageId` property keeps the information about this link.
            You can use this property to derive an implicit conversation from a set of messages.
              - If a received reply message has a `relatedSentMessageId`, you can use it to retrieve the last message that was sent before the reply was received.
              - If you have the `id` of the sent message and you want all the received messages that relate to it, you can use the List Related Messages Operation.

      description: |
        The API uses HTTP Basic Auth for authentication.

        You are requested to preemptively provide the `Authorization` header in your requests and not wait until the server has provided a `401 Unauthorized` response.

        Doing so will reduce the number of requests required to achieve your goal, which will improve overall performance.

        You authenticate using either the username you supplied when you registered with [BulkSMS](https://www.bulksms.com) or with an _API Token_. API tokens can be created by logging into your account and visiting _Settings &gt; Developer Settings &gt; API Tokens_.

        __Important:__
        - Where possible, use an API Token instead of the username and password when writing software against the API.

        Whether you use a username or an API Token, the values must be [Base64 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) before using it in the header.
        For example, if the username is `Aladdin` and the password is `OpenSesame`, the unencoded header value is `Aladdin:OpenSesame`.  After encoding, the full header becomes

        ```
        Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l
        ```
        When using an API token, the value to be encoded will be `<token-id>:<token-secret>`.  These values _before Base64 encoding_ look something like this
