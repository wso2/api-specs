  title: Tableau REST API OpenAPI Endpoints
  description: |-
    Versions: <i>Tableau Server 2021.1 / Tableau Online March 2022 and later</i> 

     This documentation describes the growing number OpenAPI endpoints  being released alongside more than 150 [classic REST endpoints](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref.htm)  that are currently in wide usage in the Tableau community. 

     There are some differences users of the classic endpoints will recognize when viewing these new endpoints. 

     - Request bodies for these new REST endpoints must  be formatted using JSON. 

     -  Endpoint URIs may contain a hyphen ('-') instead of an API version number, indicating that the resource is versioned separately from the numbered API release. For more information, see  [REST API and Resource Versions](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_concepts_versions.htm). 

     > Starting in Tableau Server 2022.1 / Tableau Online March 2022, differences between releases will be noted in this reference.To view the previous version of this reference, see [Tableau REST API OpenAPI Endpoints (v2021.4)](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/TAG/index.html#operation/addAnalyticsExtensionsConnection).

  - name: Analytics Extensions Settings Methods
    description: |-
      Enable and configure [analytics extensions](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/config_r_tabpy.htm) on sites and, for on premise installations, on servers. With these extensions you can extend Tableau dynamic calculations with languages like R and python, and with other tools and platforms. For more information, see [Analytics Extensions API](https://tableau.github.io/analytics-extensions-api/). 

      When upgrading from a server version less than 2020.2, analytics extensions must be enabled on each site even if external services were enabled on the server being upgraded. Connections for sites must be ported manually. 

      Using the analytics extensions settings methods you can: <ul> <li>Enable and disable analytics extensions for a Tableau server (on-premise only) or for a site.</li> <li>Create and manage an extension's connections to the service hosting your custom calculations.</li> </ul>
  - name: Dashboard Extensions Settings Methods
    description: |-
      Enable and configure security for [dashboard extensions](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/config_r_tabpy.htm) on sites and, for on premise installations, on servers. With these extensions you can add custom features to a dashboard using JavaScript. 

      Using the extension methods of the Tableau Server REST API you can: <ul> <li>List the settings for extensions of a server or site</li> <li>Enable or disable extensions or sandboxed extensions for a server or site</li> <li>List, get, create, and delete entries in server blocked extensions list</li> <li>List, get, create, update, and delete entries in server allowed (safe) extensions list</li> </ul> 

      This functionality relates to the UI elements and concepts described at [Manage Dashboard Settings](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/dashboard_extensions_server.htm).
