          entity or entries within a collection.

      description: |
        Creates a comment on node **nodeId**. You specify the comment in a JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        {
          "content": "This is a comment"
        }
        ```

        **Note:** You can create more than one comment by
        specifying a list of comments in the JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        [
          {
            "content": "This is a comment"
          },
          {
            "content": "This is another comment"
          }
        ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:

        ```JSON
        {
          "list": {
            "pagination": {
              "count": 2,

        Creates a tag on the node **nodeId**. You specify the tag in a JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        {
          "tag":"test-tag-1"
        }
        ```

        **Note:** You can create more than one tag by
        specifying a list of tags in the JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        [
          {
            "tag":"test-tag-1"
          },

            "tag":"test-tag-2"
          }
        ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:

        ```JSON

      summary: Update a node
      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Updates the node **nodeId**. For example, you can rename a file or folder:
        ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My new name"
        }
        ```
        You can also set or update one or more properties:
        ```JSON
        {
          "properties":
          {
            "cm:title":"Folder title"
          }
        }
        ```
        You can update multi-value properties of a node which supports properties of type multiple.
         ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My Other Folder",
          "nodeType":"custom:destination",
          "properties":
          {
            "cm:title":"Folder title",
            "cm:description":"This is an important folder",
            "custom:locations": [
                                 "location NewX",
                                 "location NewY"
                                ]
          }
        }
        ```

        **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.

        **Note:** if you want to add or remove aspects, then you must use **GET /nodes/{nodeId}** first to get the complete set of *aspectNames*.

        You can add (or remove) *locallySet* permissions, if any, in addition to any inherited permissions.
        You can also optionally disable (or re-enable) inherited permissions via *isInheritanceEnabled* flag:
        ```JSON
        {
          "permissions":
            {
              "isInheritanceEnabled": false,
              "locallySet":
                [
                  {"authorityId": "GROUP_special", "name": "Read", "accessStatus":"DENIED"},
                  {"authorityId": "testuser", "name": "Contributor", "accessStatus":"ALLOWED"}
                ]
            }
        }
        ```
        **Note:** if you want to add or remove locally set permissions then you must use **GET /nodes/{nodeId}** first to get the complete set of *locallySet* permissions.

        **Note:** Currently there is no optimistic locking for updates, so they are applied in "last one wins" order.

        Deletes the node **nodeId**.

        If **nodeId** is a folder, then its children are also deleted.

        Deleted nodes move to the trashcan unless the **permanent** query parameter is **true** and the current user is the owner of the node or an admin.

        Deleting a node deletes it from its primary parent and also from any secondary parents. Peer associations are also deleted, where the deleted
        node is either a source or target of an association. This applies recursively to any hierarchy of primary children of the deleted node.

        **Note:** If the node is not permanently deleted, and is later successfully restored to its former primary parent, then the primary
        child association is restored. This applies recursively for any primary children. No other secondary child associations or
        peer associations are restored for any of the nodes in the primary parent-child hierarchy of restored nodes, regardless of whether the original
        associations were to nodes inside or outside the restored hierarchy.

        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Gets a list of children of the parent node **nodeId**.

        Minimal information for each child is returned by default.

        You can use the **include** parameter to return additional information.

        The list of child nodes includes primary children and secondary children, if there are any.

        You can use the **include** parameter (include=association) to return child association details
        for each child, including the **assocTyp**e and the **isPrimary** flag.

        The default sort order for the returned list is for folders to be sorted before files, and by ascending name.

        You can override the default using **orderBy** to specify one or more fields to sort by. The default order is always ascending, but
        you can use an optional **ASC** or **DESC** modifier to specify an ascending or descending sort order.

        For example, specifying ```orderBy=name DESC``` returns a mixed folder/file list in descending **name** order.

        You can use any of the following fields to order the results:
        * isFolder
        * name
        * mimeType
        * nodeType
        * sizeInBytes

      summary: Create a node
      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Create a node and add it as a primary child of node **nodeId**.

        This endpoint supports both JSON and multipart/form-data (file upload).

        **Using multipart/form-data**

        Use the **filedata** field to represent the content to upload, for example, the following curl command will
        create a node with the contents of test.txt in the test user's home folder.

        ```curl -utest:test -X POST host:port/alfresco/api/-default-/public/alfresco/versions/1/nodes/-my-/children -F filedata=@test.txt```

        You can use the **name** field to give an alternative name for the new file.

        You can use the **nodeType** field to create a specific type. The default is cm:content.

        You can use the **renditions** field to create renditions (e.g. doclib) asynchronously upon upload.
        Also, as requesting rendition is a background process,
        any rendition failure (e.g. No transformer is currently available) will not fail the whole upload and has the potential to silently fail.

        Use **overwrite** to overwrite an existing file, matched by name. If the file is versionable,
        the existing content is replaced.

        When you overwrite existing content, you can set the **majorVersion** boolean field to **true** to indicate a major version
        should be created. The default for **majorVersion** is **false**.
        Setting  **majorVersion** enables versioning of the node, if it is not already versioned.

        When you overwrite existing content, you can use the **comment** field to add a version comment that appears in the
        version history. This also enables versioning of this node, if it is not already versioned.

        You can set the **autoRename** boolean field to automatically resolve name clashes. If there is a name clash, then
        the API method tries to create a unique name using an integer suffix.

        You can use the **relativePath** field to specify the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**.
        Folders in the **relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.

        Any other field provided will be treated as a property to set on the newly created node.

        **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.

        **Note:** When creating a new node using multipart/form-data by default versioning is enabled and set to MAJOR Version.
        Since Alfresco 6.2.3 **versioningEnabled** flag was introduced offering better control over the new node Versioning.

        | **versioningEnabled** | **majorVersion** | **Version Type** |
        |-----------------------|------------------|------------------|
        |        unset          |        unset     |    MAJOR         |
        |        unset          |        true      |    MAJOR         |
        |        unset          |        false     |    MINOR         |
        |        true           |        unset     |    MAJOR         |
        |        true           |        true      |    MAJOR         |
        |        true           |        false     |    MINOR         |
        |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   |
        |        false          |        false     |    Unversioned   |
        |        false          |        true      |    Unversioned   |
        <br>

        **Using JSON**

        You must specify at least a **name** and **nodeType**. For example, to create a folder:
        ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My Folder",
          "nodeType":"cm:folder"
        }
        ```

        You can create an empty file like this:
        ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My text file.txt",
          "nodeType":"cm:content"
        }
        ```
        You can update binary content using the ```PUT /nodes/{nodeId}``` API method.

        You can create a folder, or other node, inside a folder hierarchy:
        ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My Special Folder",
          "nodeType":"cm:folder",
          "relativePath":"X/Y/Z"
        }
        ```
        The **relativePath** specifies the folder structure to create relative to the node **nodeId**. Folders in the
        **relativePath** that do not exist are created before the node is created.

        You can set properties when you create a new node:
        ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My Other Folder",
          "nodeType":"cm:folder",
          "properties":
          {
            "cm:title":"Folder title",
            "cm:description":"This is an important folder"
          }
        }
        ```

        You can set multi-value properties when you create a new node which supports properties of type multiple.
         ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My Other Folder",
          "nodeType":"custom:destination",
          "properties":
          {
            "cm:title":"Folder title",
            "cm:description":"This is an important folder",
            "custom:locations": [
                                 "location X",
                                 "location Y"
                                ]
          }
        }
        ```

        Any missing aspects are applied automatically. For example, **cm:titled** in the JSON shown above. You can set aspects
        explicitly, if needed, using an **aspectNames** field.

        **Note:** setting properties of type d:content and d:category are not supported.

        You can also optionally disable (or enable) inherited permissions via *isInheritanceEnabled* flag:
        ```JSON
        {
          "permissions":
            {
              "isInheritanceEnabled": false,
              "locallySet":
                [
                  {"authorityId": "GROUP_special", "name": "Read", "accessStatus":"DENIED"},
                  {"authorityId": "testuser", "name": "Contributor", "accessStatus":"ALLOWED"}
                ]
            }
        }
        ```

        Typically, for files and folders, the primary children are created within the parent folder using the default "cm:contains" assocType.
        If the content model allows then it is also possible to create primary children with a different assoc type. For example:
        ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My Node",
          "nodeType":"my:specialNodeType",
          "association":
          {
            "assocType":"my:specialAssocType"
          }
        }
        ```

        Additional associations can be added after creating a node. You can also add associations at the time the node is created. This is
        required, for example, if the content model specifies that a node has mandatory associations to one or more existing nodes. You can optionally
        specify an array of **secondaryChildren** to create one or more secondary child associations, such that the newly created node acts as a parent node.
        You can optionally specify an array of **targets** to create one or more peer associations such that the newly created node acts as a source node.
        For example, to associate one or more secondary children at time of creation:
        ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My Folder",
          "nodeType":"cm:folder",
          "secondaryChildren":
            [ {"childId":"abcde-01234-...", "assocType":"my:specialChildAssocType"} ]
        }
        ```
        For example, to associate one or more targets at time of creation:
        ```JSON
        {
          "name":"My Folder",
          "nodeType":"cm:folder",
          "targets":
            [ {"targetId":"abcde-01234-...", "assocType":"my:specialPeerAssocType"} ]
        }
        ```

        **Note:** You can create more than one child by
        specifying a list of nodes in the JSON body. For example, the following JSON
        body creates two folders inside the specified **nodeId**, if the **nodeId** identifies
        a folder:

        ```JSON
        [
          {
            "name":"My Folder 1",
            "nodeType":"cm:folder"
          },
          {
            "name":"My Folder 2",
            "nodeType":"cm:folder"
          }
        ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:

        ```JSON
        {
          "list": {
            "pagination": {
              "count": 2,
              "hasMoreItems": false,
              "totalItems": 2,
              "skipCount": 0,
              "maxItems": 100
            },
            "entries": [
              {
                "entry": {
                  ...
                }
              },
              {
                "entry": {
                  ...
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
        **Note:** When creating a new node using JSON by default versioning is disabled.
        Since Alfresco 6.2.3 **versioningEnabled** flag was introduced offering better control over the new node Versioning.

      summary: Lock a node
      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Places a lock on node **nodeId**.

        **Note:** you can only lock files. More specifically, a node can only be locked if it is
        of type `cm:content` or a subtype of `cm:content`.

        The lock is owned by the current user, and prevents other users or processes from making updates to the node until the lock is released.

        If the **timeToExpire** is not set or is zero, then the lock never expires.  Otherwise, the **timeToExpire** is the number of seconds before the lock expires.

        When a lock expires, the lock is released.

        If the node is already locked, and the user is the lock owner, then the lock is renewed with the new **timeToExpire**.

        By default, a lock is applied that allows the owner to update or delete the node.
        You can use **type** to change the lock type to one of the following:
        * **ALLOW_OWNER_CHANGES** (default) changes to the node can be made only by the lock owner. This enum is the same value as the deprecated WRITE_LOCK described in `org.alfresco.service.cmr.lock.LockType` in the Alfresco Public Java API. This is the default value.
        * **FULL** no changes by any user are allowed. This enum is the same value as the deprecated READ_ONLY_LOCK described in `org.alfresco.service.cmr.lock.LockType` in the Alfresco Public Java API.

        By default, a lock is persisted in the database. You can create a volatile in-memory lock by setting the **lifetime** property to EPHEMERAL.
        You might choose use EPHEMERAL locks, for example, if you are taking frequent short-term locks that you don't need
        to be kept over a restart of the repository. In this case you don't need the
        overhead of writing the locks to the database.

        If a lock on the node cannot be taken, then an error is returned.

        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Updates the content of the node with identifier **nodeId**.

        The request body for this endpoint can be any text or binary stream.

        The **majorVersion** and **comment** parameters can be used to control versioning behaviour. If the content is versionable,
        a new minor version is created by default.

        Optionally a new **name** parameter can also be specified that must be unique within the parent folder. If specified and valid then this
        will rename the node. If invalid then an error is returned and the content is not updated.

        **Note:** This API method accepts any content type, but for testing with this tool text based content can be provided.
        This is because the OpenAPI Specification does not allow a wildcard to be provided or the ability for
        tooling to accept an arbitrary file.

      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Create a secondary child association, with the given association type, between the parent **nodeId** and a child node.

        **Note:** You can create more than one secondary child association by
        specifying a list of associations in the JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        [
          {
            "childId": "string",
            "assocType": "string"
          },
          {
            "childId": "string",
            "assocType": "string"
          }
        ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:

        ```JSON
        {
          "list": {
            "pagination": {
              "count": 2,
              "hasMoreItems": false,
              "totalItems": 2,
              "skipCount": 0,
              "maxItems": 100
            },
            "entries": [
              {
                "entry": {

      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Create an association, with the given association type, between the source **nodeId** and a target node.

        **Note:** You can create more than one association by
        specifying a list of associations in the JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        [
          {
             "targetId": "string",
             "assocType": "string"
          },
          {
            "targetId": "string",
            "assocType": "string"
          }
        ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:

        ```JSON
        {
          "list": {
            "pagination": {
              "count": 2,
              "hasMoreItems": false,
              "totalItems": 2,
              "skipCount": 0,
              "maxItems": 100
            },
            "entries": [
              {
                "entry": {
                  ...
                }
              },
              {
                "entry": {
                  ...
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        If the version is successfully deleted then the content and metadata for that versioned node
        will be deleted and will no longer appear in the version history. This operation cannot be undone.

        If the most recent version is deleted the live node will revert to the next most recent version.

        We currently do not allow the last version to be deleted. If you wish to clear the history then you
        can remove the "cm:versionable" aspect (via update node) which will also disable versioning. In this
        case, you can re-enable versioning by adding back the "cm:versionable" aspect or using the version
        params (majorVersion and comment) on a subsequent file content update.

        children. It should be noted that no other secondary child associations or peer
        associations will be restored, for any of the nodes within the primary parent-child
        hierarchy of restored nodes, irrespective of whether these associations were to
        nodes within or outside of the restored hierarchy.

        Also, any previously shared link will not be restored since it is deleted at the time
        of delete of each node.

        By default, if the download node is not deleted it will be picked up by a cleaner job which removes download nodes older than a configurable amount of time (default is 1 hour)

        Information about the existing progress at the time of cancelling can be retrieved by calling the **GET /downloads/{downloadId}** endpoint

        The cancel operation is done asynchronously.

        **Note:** this endpoint is deprecated as of Alfresco 4.2, and will be removed in the future.
        Use `/people/{personId}/favorites` instead.

        Create a site favorite for person **personId**.

        You can use the `-me-` string in place of `<personId>` to specify the currently authenticated user.

         **Note:** You can favorite more than one site by
        specifying a list of sites in the JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        [
          {
            "id": "test-site-1"
          },
          {
            "id": "test-site-2"
          }
        ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:

        ```JSON
        {
          "list": {
            "pagination": {
              "count": 2,
              "hasMoreItems": false,
              "totalItems": 2,
              "skipCount": 0,
              "maxItems": 100
            },
            "entries": [
              {
                "entry": {

      description: |
        Gets a list of favorites for person **personId**.

        You can use the `-me-` string in place of `<personId>` to specify the currently authenticated user.

        The default sort order for the returned list of favorites is type ascending, createdAt descending.
        You can override the default by using the **orderBy** parameter.

        You can use any of the following fields to order the results:
        *   `type`
        *   `createdAt`
        *   `title`

        You can use the **where** parameter to restrict the list in the response
        to entries of a specific kind. The **where** parameter takes a value.
        The value is a single predicate that can include one or more **EXISTS**
        conditions. The **EXISTS** condition uses a single operand to limit the
        list to include entries that include that one property. The property values are:

        *   `target/file`
        *   `target/folder`
        *   `target/site`

        For example, the following **where** parameter restricts the returned list to the file favorites for a person:

        ```SQL
        (EXISTS(target/file))
        ```
        You can specify more than one condition using **OR**. The predicate must be enclosed in parentheses.


        For example, the following **where** parameter restricts the returned list to the file and folder favorites for a person:

        ```SQL
        (EXISTS(target/file) OR EXISTS(target/folder))
        ```

          above to check if any fields used in this method have a descending default search order.

      summary: Create a favorite
      description: |
        Favorite a **site**, **file**, or **folder** in the repository.

        You can use the `-me-` string in place of `<personId>` to specify the currently authenticated user.

        **Note:** You can favorite more than one entity by
        specifying a list of objects in the JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        [
          {
               "target": {
                  "file": {
                     "guid": "abcde-01234-...."
                  }
               }
           },
           {
               "target": {
                  "file": {
                     "guid": "abcde-09863-...."
                  }
               }
           },
        ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:

        ```JSON
        {
          "list": {
            "pagination": {
              "count": 2,
              "hasMoreItems": false,
              "totalItems": 2,
              "skipCount": 0,
              "maxItems": 100
            },
            "entries": [
              {
                "entry": {
                  ...

              },

              }
            ]
          }
        }

         a result set even further. For example, the following where clause will only return groups belonging to the
         `MY.ZONE` zone.

         ```
         where=(zones in ('MY.ZONE'))
         ```

         This may be combined with the isRoot filter, as shown below:

         ```
         where=(isRoot=false AND zones in ('MY.ZONE'))
         ```

         ***Note:*** restrictions include
         * `AND` is the only supported operator when combining `isRoot` and `zones` filters
         * Only one zone is supported by the filter
         * The quoted zone name must be placed in parenthesis â€” a 400 error will result if these are omitted.


         The default sort order for the returned list is for groups to be sorted by ascending displayName.
         You can override the default by using the **orderBy** parameter. You can specify one or more of the following fields in the **orderBy** parameter:
         * id
         * displayName

      description: |
        Gets a list of sites in this repository.

        You can use the **where** parameter to filter the returned sites by **visibility** or site **preset**.

        Example to filter by **visibility**, use any one of:

        ```
        (visibility='PRIVATE')
        (visibility='PUBLIC')
        (visibility='MODERATED')
        ```

        Example to filter by site **preset**:

        ```
        (preset='site-dashboard')
        ```

        The default sort order for the returned list is for sites to be sorted by ascending title.
        You can override the default by using the **orderBy** parameter. You can specify one or more of the following fields in the **orderBy** parameter:
        * id
        * title
        * description

        You can use the **relations** parameter to include one or more related
        entities in a single response and so reduce network traffic.

        The entity types in Alfresco are organized in a tree structure.
        The **sites** entity has two children, **containers** and **members**.
        The following relations parameter returns all the container and member

      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Creates a default site with the given details.  Unless explicitly specified, the site id will be generated
        from the site title. The site id must be unique and only contain alphanumeric and/or dash characters.

        Note: the id of a site cannot be updated once the site has been created.

        For example, to create a public site called "Marketing" the following body could be used:
        ```JSON
        {
          "title": "Marketing",
          "visibility": "PUBLIC"
        }
        ```

        The creation of the (surf) configuration files required by Share can be skipped via the **skipConfiguration** query parameter.

        **Note:** if skipped then such a site will **not** work within Share.

        The addition of the site to the user's site favorites can be skipped via the **skipAddToFavorites** query parameter.

        The creator will be added as a member with Site Manager role.

        When you create a site, a container called **documentLibrary** is created for you in the new site.
        This container is the root folder for content stored in the site.

      summary: Create a site membership
      description: |
        Creates a site membership for person **personId** on site **siteId**.

        You can set the **role** to one of four types:

        * SiteConsumer
        * SiteCollaborator
        * SiteContributor
        * SiteManager

        **Note:** You can create more than one site membership by
        specifying a list of people in the JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        [
          {
            "role": "SiteConsumer",
            "id": "joe"
          },
          {
            "role": "SiteConsumer",
            "id": "fred"
          }
        ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:

        ```JSON
        {
          "list": {
            "pagination": {
              "count": 2,
              "hasMoreItems": false,
              "totalItems": 2,
              "skipCount": 0,
              "maxItems": 100
            },
            "entries": [
              {
                "entry": {
                  ...
                }
              },
              {

                  ...
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }

      summary: Create a site membership for group
      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 7.0.0 and newer versions.

        Creates a site membership for group **groupId** on site **siteId**.
        You can set the **role** to one of four types:
        * SiteConsumer
        * SiteCollaborator
        * SiteContributor
        * SiteManager
        **Note:** You can create more than one site membership by
        specifying a list of group in the JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
          [
           {
             "role": "SiteConsumer",
             "id": "authorityId"
           },
           {
             "role": "SiteConsumer",
             "id": "authorityId"
           }
          ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:
        ```JSON
          {
            "list": {
              "pagination": {
                "count": 2,
                "hasMoreItems": false,
                "totalItems": 2,
                "skipCount": 0,
                "maxItems": 100
              },
              "entries": [
                {
                  "entry": {
                    ...
                  }
                },
                {
                  "entry": {
                    ...
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        ```

      summary: Create a shared link to a file
      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Create a shared link to the file **nodeId** in the request body. Also, an optional expiry date could be set,
        so the shared link would become invalid when the expiry date is reached. For example:

        ```JSON
          {
            "nodeId": "1ff9da1a-ee2f-4b9c-8c34-3333333333",
            "expiresAt": "2017-03-23T23:00:00.000+0000"
          }
        ```

        **Note:** You can create shared links to more than one file
        specifying a list of **nodeId**s in the JSON body like this:

        ```JSON
        [
          {
            "nodeId": "1ff9da1a-ee2f-4b9c-8c34-4444444444"
          },
          {
            "nodeId": "1ff9da1a-ee2f-4b9c-8c34-5555555555"
          }
        ]
        ```
        If you specify a list as input, then a paginated list rather than an entry is returned in the response body. For example:

        ```JSON
        {
          "list": {
            "pagination": {
              "count": 2,
              "hasMoreItems": false,
              "totalItems": 2,
              "skipCount": 0,
              "maxItems": 100
            },
            "entries": [
              {
                "entry": {
                  ...
                }
              },
              {
                "entry": {
                  ...
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }

      summary: Email shared link
      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Sends email with app-specific url including identifier **sharedId**.

        The client and recipientEmails properties are mandatory in the request body. For example, to email a shared link with minimum info:
        ```JSON
        {
            "client": "myClient",
            "recipientEmails": ["john.doe@acme.com", "joe.bloggs@acme.com"]
        }
        ```
        A plain text message property can be optionally provided in the request body to customise the sent email.
        Also, a locale property can be optionally provided in the request body to send the emails in a particular language (if the locale is supported by Alfresco).
        For example, to email a shared link with a messages and a locale:
        ```JSON
        {
            "client": "myClient",
            "recipientEmails": ["john.doe@acme.com", "joe.bloggs@acme.com"],
            "message": "myMessage",
            "locale":"en-GB"
        }
        ```
        **Note:** The client must be registered before you can send a shared link email. See [server documentation]. However, out-of-the-box
         share is registered as a default client, so you could pass **share** as the client name:
        ```JSON
        {
            "client": "share",
            "recipientEmails": ["john.doe@acme.com"]
        }
        ```

        The group id must start with "GROUP\_". If this is omitted it will be added automatically.
        This format is also returned when listing groups or group memberships. It should be noted
        that the other group-related operations also expect the id to start with "GROUP\_".

        If one or more parentIds are specified then the group will be created and become a member
        of each of the specified parent groups.

        If no parentIds are specified then the group will be created as a root group.

        The group will be created in the **APP.DEFAULT** and **AUTH.ALF** zones.

        You must have admin rights to create a group.

      summary: Execute an action
      description: |
        **Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.

        Executes an action

        An action may be executed against a node specified by **targetId**. For example:

        ```
        {
          "actionDefinitionId": "copy",
          "targetId": "4c4b3c43-f18b-43ff-af84-751f16f1ddfd",
          "params": {
            "destination-folder": "34219f79-66fa-4ebf-b371-118598af898c"
          }
        }
        ```

        Performing a POST with the request body shown above will result in the node identified by ```targetId```
        being copied to the destination folder specified in the ```params``` object by the key ```destination-folder```.

        **targetId** is optional, however, currently **targetId** must be a valid node ID.
        In the future, actions may be executed against different entity types or
        executed without the need for the context of an entity.


        Parameters supplied to the action within the ```params``` object will be converted to the expected type,
        where possible using the DefaultTypeConverter class. In addition:

        * Node IDs may be supplied in their short form (implicit workspace://SpacesStore prefix)
        * Aspect names may be supplied using their short form, e.g. cm:versionable or cm:auditable

        In this example, we add the aspect ```cm:versionable``` to a node using the QName resolution mentioned above:

        ```
        {
          "actionDefinitionId": "add-features",
          "targetId": "16349e3f-2977-44d1-93f2-73c12b8083b5",
          "params": {
            "aspect-name": "cm:versionable"
          }
        }
        ```

        The ```actionDefinitionId``` is the ```id``` of an action definition as returned by
        the _list actions_ operations (e.g. GET /action-definitions).

        The action will be executed **asynchronously** with a `202` HTTP response signifying that
        the request has been accepted successfully. The response body contains the unique ID of the action
        pending execution. The ID may be used, for example to correlate an execution with output in the server logs.

        You can use this parameter to restrict the fields
        returned within a response if, for example, you want to save on overall bandwidth.

        The list applies to a returned individual
        entity or entries within a collection.

        If the API method also supports the **include**
        parameter, then the fields specified in the **include**
        parameter are returned in addition to those specified in the **fields** parameter.

        sort the list by one or more fields.

        Each field has a default sort order, which is normally ascending order. Read the API method implementation notes
        above to check if any fields used in this method have a descending default search order.

        To sort the entities in a specific order, you can use the **ASC** and **DESC** keywords for any field.

        the attachment will be returned in the response.
