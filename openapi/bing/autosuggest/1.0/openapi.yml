  description: >
    This is a generated connector for [Bing Autosuggest API v1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-autosuggest-api) OpenAPI specification.
    
    "The Autosuggest API lets partners send a partial search query to Bing\
    \ and get back a list of suggested queries that other users have searched on.\
    \ In addition to including searches that other users have made, the list may include\
    \ suggestions based on user intent. For example, if the query string is weather\
    \ in Lo, the list will include relevant weather suggestions.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTypically,\
    \ you use this API to support an auto-suggest search box feature. For example,\
    \ as the user types a query into the search box, you would call this API to populate\
    \ a drop-down list of suggested query strings. If the user selects a query from\
    \ the list, you would either send the user to the Bing search results page for\
    \ the selected query or call the Bing Search API to get the search results and\
    \ display the results yourself.\r\n"
