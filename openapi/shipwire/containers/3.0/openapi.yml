  description: |
    This is a generated connector for [Shipwire Containers API v3.0](https://www.shipwire.com/developers/container/) OpenAPI specification.
    The Container API is used to manage shipping containers and boxes within Shipwire Anywhere warehouses and dropship locations. 
    Use it to create a new container, to update an existing container, or to get information about already created containers.
  x-ballerina-init-description: >
    The connector initialization requires setting the API credentials. 
  
    Create a [Shipwire account](https://www.shipwire.com) and obtain tokens by following [this guide](https://www.shipwire.com/developers/getting-started).
